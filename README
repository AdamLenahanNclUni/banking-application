Banking application for assessment 2
===================================
Overview of the program
-----------------------
This application uses object oriented programming along with a procedural terminal interface allow the user to act
as an administrator for a bank. This means that the user is allowed access to all accounts to edit, make deposits
and make withdrawals as they see fit alongside creating and deleteing new accounts. Account details are stored in a
csv file for later use.

Users are allowed to query the csv file to search for specific users. When editing user's details (eg making a deposit
to change their balance) the row representing the user is saved to an object and changes are made in an object oriented
manner.

Assumptions
-----------
It is assumed that no two people will share an id.
It is assumed that the user will not deliberately try and break the program by entering "id" when making changes to users
It is assumed that a user can be created with a negative amount of money in their bank account.

How to run
----------
type "python terminal_menu.py" in the terminal. Follow the instructions as they come up to complete the tasks you want
to complete.

Specific Use Case
----------------
open the terminal menu as discussed in the "how to run" section of this file. Wait for the program to load. Select an
option from the main menu.

If you enter 1 you will be required to enter the user's first name, last name, title, prefered
pronouns, date of birth, occupation, current balance and overdraught limit. Once this is done (provided all data is entered
correctly) an id will be generated for the user and the user will be added to the csv file. If at any point you enter
invalid data eg ("aaa" for date of birth) you will be asked to try again until you enter valid data.

If you enter 2 you will be presented with a list of all the first names, last names and Ids of the users in the csv file.
You will then be asked to enter the id that corresponds to the user you want to delete. If you enter a valid id then you
will be presented with a list of all the users still in the csv file and the user with the id you entered will be deleted.
If you enter an invalid id then the program will print that the id is invalid and will ask you to try again until
you enter a valid id.

If you enter 3 in the main menu then you will be presented with a list of all the ids firsst names and last names of the
users in

Pressing 8 will end the program.
